§1395ww. Payments to hospitals for inpatient hospital services
(a) Determination of costs for inpatient hospital services; limitations; exemptions; “operating costs of inpatient hospital services” defined

(1)(A)(i) The Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments that may be made under this subchapter with respect to operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in paragraph (4)) shall not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of health services) costs for the provision of such services by a hospital for a cost reporting period to the extent such costs exceed the applicable percentage (as determined under clause (ii)) of the average of such costs for all hospitals in the same grouping as such hospital for comparable time periods.

(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage for hospital cost reporting periods beginning-

(I) on or after October 1, 1982, and before October 1, 1983, is 120 percent;

(II) on or after October 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1984, is 115 percent; and

(III) on or after October 1, 1984, is 110 percent.

(B)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A) the Secretary shall establish case mix indexes for all short-term hospitals, and shall set limits for each hospital based upon the general mix of types of medical cases with respect to which such hospital provides services for which payment may be made under this subchapter.

(ii) The Secretary shall set such limits for a cost reporting period of a hospital-

(I) by updating available data for a previous period to the immediate preceding cost reporting period by the estimated average rate of change of hospital costs industry-wide, and

(II) by projecting for the cost reporting period by the applicable percentage increase (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section).

(C) The limitation established under subparagraph (A) for any hospital shall in no event be lower than the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in paragraph (4)) recognized under this subchapter for such hospital for such hospital's last cost reporting period prior to the hospital's first cost reporting period for which this section is in effect.

(D) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983.

(2) The Secretary shall provide for such exemptions from, and exceptions and adjustments to, the limitation established under paragraph (1)(A) as he deems appropriate, including those which he deems necessary to take into account-

(A) the special needs of sole community hospitals, of new hospitals, of risk based health maintenance organizations, and of hospitals which provide atypical services or essential community services, and to take into account extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control, medical and paramedical education costs, significantly fluctuating population in the service area of the hospital, and unusual labor costs,

(B) the special needs of psychiatric hospitals and of public or other hospitals that serve a significantly disproportionate number of patients who have low income or are entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and

(C) a decrease in the inpatient hospital services that a hospital provides and that are customarily provided directly by similar hospitals which results in a significant distortion in the operating costs of inpatient hospital services.

(3) The limitation established under paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply with respect to any hospital which-

(A) is located outside of a standard metropolitan statistical area, and

(B)(i) has less than 50 beds, and

(ii) was in operation and had less than 50 beds on September 3, 1982.

(4) For purposes of this section, the term “operating costs of inpatient hospital services” includes all routine operating costs, ancillary service operating costs, and special care unit operating costs with respect to inpatient hospital services as such costs are determined on an average per admission or per discharge basis (as determined by the Secretary), and includes the costs of all services for which payment may be made under this subchapter that are provided by the hospital (or by an entity wholly owned or operated by the hospital) to the patient during the 3 days (or, in the case of a hospital that is not a subsection (d) hospital, during the 1 day) immediately preceding the date of the patient's admission if such services are diagnostic services (including clinical diagnostic laboratory tests) or are other services related to the admission (as defined by the Secretary). Such term does not include costs of approved educational activities, a return on equity capital, or,1 other capital-related costs (as defined by the Secretary for periods before October 1, 1987).
(b) Computation of payment; definitions; exemptions; adjustments

(1) Notwithstanding section 1395f(b) of this title but subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, if the operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section) of a hospital (other than a subsection (d) hospital, as defined in subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section) for a cost reporting period subject to this paragraph-

(A) are less than or equal to the target amount (as defined in paragraph (3)) for that hospital for that period, the amount of the payment with respect to such operating costs payable under part A of this subchapter on a per discharge or per admission basis (as the case may be) shall be equal to the amount of such operating costs, plus-

(i) 50 percent of the amount by which the target amount exceeds the amount of the operating costs, or

(ii) 5 percent of the target amount,

whichever is less; or

(B) are greater than the target amount, the amount of the payment with respect to such operating costs payable under part A of this subchapter on a per discharge or per admission basis (as the case may be) shall be equal to (i) the target amount, plus (ii) in the case of cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the amount by which the operating costs exceed the target amount (except that such additional amount may not exceed 10 percent of the target amount) after any exceptions or adjustments are made to such target amount for the cost reporting period;

except that in no case may the amount payable under this subchapter (other than on the basis of a DRG prospective payment rate determined under subsection (d) of this section) with respect to operating costs of inpatient hospital services exceed the maximum amount payable with respect to such costs pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

(IV) for fiscal year 1996 and each subsequent fiscal year, the applicable percentage increase under clause (i).

(v) For purposes of clause (ii)(V)-

(II) the “applicable reduction” with respect to a hospital for a fiscal year is the lesser of 1 percentage point or the percentage point difference between 10 percent and the hospital's update adjustment percentage for the fiscal year.

(C) In the case of a hospital that is a sole community hospital (as defined in subsection (d)(5)(D)(iii) of this section), the term “target amount” means-

(i) with respect to the first 12-month cost reporting period in which this subparagraph is applied to the hospital-

(I) the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period (in this subparagraph referred to as the “base cost reporting period”) preceding the first cost reporting period for which this subsection was in effect with respect to such hospital, increased (in a compounded manner) by-

(II) the applicable percentage increases applied to such hospital under this paragraph for cost reporting periods after the base cost reporting period and up to and including such first 12-month cost reporting period,

(ii) with respect to a later cost reporting period beginning before fiscal year 1994, the target amount for the preceding 12-month cost reporting period, increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv) for discharges occurring in the fiscal year in which that later cost reporting period begins,

(iii) with respect to discharges occurring in fiscal year 1994, the target amount for the cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1993 increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv), or

(iv) with respect to discharges occurring in fiscal year 1995 and each subsequent fiscal year, the target amount for the preceding year increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv).

There shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period described in clause (i) a hospital's cost reporting period (if any) beginning during fiscal year 1987 if such substitution results in an increase in the target amount for the hospital.

(D) For cost reporting periods ending on or before September 30, 1994, in the case of a hospital that is a medicare-dependent, small rural hospital (as defined in subsection (d)(5)(G) of this section), the term “target amount” means-

(i) with respect to the first 12-month cost reporting period in which this subparagraph is applied to the hospital-

(I) the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period (in this subparagraph referred to as the “base cost reporting period”) preceding the first cost reporting period for which this subsection was in effect with respect to such hospital, increased (in a compounded manner) by-

(II) the applicable percentage increases applied to such hospital under this paragraph for cost reporting periods after the base cost reporting period and up to and including such first 12-month cost reporting period, or

(ii) with respect to a later cost reporting period beginning before fiscal year 1994, the target amount for the preceding 12-month cost reporting period, increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv) for discharges occurring in the fiscal year in which that later cost reporting period begins, and

(iii) with respect to discharges occurring in fiscal year 1994, the target amount for the cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1993 increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(iv).

There shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period described in clause (i) a hospital's cost reporting period (if any) beginning during fiscal year 1987 if such substitution results in an increase in the target amount for the hospital.

(E) In the case of a hospital described in clause (v) of subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section, the term “target amount” means-

(i) with respect to the first 12-month cost reporting period in which this subparagraph is applied to the hospital-

(I) the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section) recognized under this subchapter for the hospital for the 12-month cost reporting period (in this subparagraph referred to as the “base cost reporting period”) preceding the first cost reporting period for which this subsection was in effect with respect to such hospital, increased (in a compounded manner) by-

(II) the sum of the applicable percentage increases applied to such hospital under this paragraph for cost reporting periods after the base cost reporting period and up to and including such first 12-month cost reporting period, or

(ii) with respect to a later cost reporting period, the target amount for the preceding 12-month cost reporting period, increased by the applicable percentage increase under subparagraph (B)(ii) for that later cost reporting period.

There shall be substituted for the base cost reporting period described in clause (i) a hospital's cost reporting period (if any) beginning during fiscal year 1987 if such substitution results in an increase in the target amount for the hospital.

(4)(A)(i) The Secretary shall provide for an exemption from, or an exception and adjustment to, the method under this subsection for determining the amount of payment to a hospital where events beyond the hospital's control or extraordinary circumstances, including changes in the case mix of such hospital, create a distortion in the increase in costs for a cost reporting period (including any distortion in the costs for the base period against which such increase is measured). The Secretary may provide for such other exemptions from, and exceptions and adjustments to, such method as the Secretary deems appropriate, including the assignment of a new base period which is more representative, as determined by the Secretary, of the reasonable and necessary cost of inpatient services and including those which he deems necessary to take into account a decrease in the inpatient hospital services that a hospital provides and that are customarily provided directly by similar hospitals which results in a significant distortion in the operating costs of inpatient hospital services. The Secretary shall announce a decision on any request for an exemption, exception, or adjustment under this paragraph not later than 180 days after receiving a completed application from the intermediary for such exemption, exception, or adjustment, and shall include in such decision a detailed explanation of the grounds on which such request was approved or denied.

(ii) The payment reductions under paragraph (3)(B)(ii)(V) shall not be considered by the Secretary in making adjustments pursuant to clause (i).

(B) In determining under subparagraph (A) whether to assign a new base period which is more representative of the reasonable and necessary cost to a hospital of providing inpatient services, the Secretary shall take into consideration-

(i) changes in applicable technologies and medical practices, or differences in the severity of illness among patients, that increase the hospital's costs;

(ii) whether increases in wages and wage-related costs for hospitals located in the geographic area in which the hospital is located exceed the average of the increases in such costs paid by hospitals in the United States; and

(iii) such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate in determining increases in the hospital's costs of providing inpatient services.

(C) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to payment of hospitals which is otherwise determined under paragraph (3) of section 1395f(b) of this title.

(5) In the case of any hospital having any cost reporting period of other than a 12-month period, the Secretary shall determine the 12-month period which shall be used for purposes of this section.

(6) In the case of any hospital which becomes subject to the taxes under section 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with respect to any or all of its employees, for part or all of a cost reporting period, and was not subject to such taxes with respect to any or all of its employees for all or part of the 12-month base cost reporting period referred to in subsection (b)(3)(A)(i) of this section, the Secretary shall provide for an adjustment by increasing the base period amount described in such subsection for such hospital by an amount equal to the amount of such taxes which would have been paid or accrued by such hospital for such base period if such hospital had been subject to such taxes for all of such base period with respect to all its employees, minus the amount of any such taxes actually paid or accrued for such base period.
(c) Payment in accordance with State hospital reimbursement control system; amount of payment; discontinuance of payments

(1) The Secretary may provide, in his discretion, that payment with respect to services provided by a hospital in a State may be made in accordance with a hospital reimbursement control system in a State, rather than in accordance with the other provisions of this title, if the chief executive officer of the State requests such treatment and if-

(A) the Secretary determines that the system, if approved under this subsection, will apply (i) to substantially all non-Federal acute care hospitals (as defined by the Secretary) in the State and (ii) to the review of at least 75 percent of all revenues or expenses in the State for inpatient hospital services and of revenues or expenses for inpatient hospital services provided under the State's plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter;

(B) the Secretary has been provided satisfactory assurances as to the equitable treatment under the system of all entities (including Federal and State programs) that pay hospitals for inpatient hospital services, of hospital employees, and of hospital patients;

(C) the Secretary has been provided satisfactory assurances that under the system, over 36-month periods (the first such period beginning with the first month in which this subsection applies to that system in the State), the amount of payments made under this subchapter under such system will not exceed the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system;

(D) the Secretary determines that the system will not preclude an eligible organization (as defined in section 1395mm(b) of this title) from negotiating directly with hospitals with respect to the organization's rate of payment for inpatient hospital services; and

(E) the Secretary determines that the system requires hospitals to meet the requirement of section 1395cc(a)(1)(G) of this title and the system provides for the exclusion of certain costs in accordance with section 1395y(a)(14) of this title (except for such waivers thereof as the Secretary provides by regulation).

The Secretary cannot deny the application of a State under this subsection on the ground that the State's hospital reimbursement control system is based on a payment methodology other than on the basis of a diagnosis-related group or on the ground that the amount of payments made under this subchapter under such system must be less than the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system. If the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subparagraph (C) are based on maintaining payment amounts at no more than a specified percentage increase above the payment amounts in a base period, the State has the option of applying such test (for inpatient hospital services under part A of this subchapter) on an aggregate payment basis or on the basis of the amount of payment per inpatient discharge or admission. If the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subparagraph (C) are based on maintaining aggregate payment amounts below a national average percentage increase in total payments under part A of this subchapter for inpatient hospital services, the Secretary cannot deny the application of a State under this subsection on the ground that the State's rate of increase in such payments for such services must be less than such national average rate of increase.

(2) In determining under paragraph (1)(C) the amount of payment which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter for a State, the Secretary may provide for appropriate adjustment of such amount to take into account previous reductions effected in the amount of payments made under this subchapter in the State due to the operation of the hospital reimbursement control system in the State if the system has resulted in an aggregate rate of increase in operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section) under this subchapter for hospitals in the State which is less than the aggregate rate of increase in such costs under this subchapter for hospitals in the United States.

(3) The Secretary shall discontinue payments under a system described in paragraph (1) if the Secretary-

(A) determines that the system no longer meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) and, if applicable, the requirements of paragraph (5), or

(B) has reason to believe that the assurances described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (1) (or, if applicable, in paragraph (5)) are not being (or will not be) met.

(4) The Secretary shall approve the request of a State under paragraph (1) with respect to a hospital reimbursement control system if-

(A) the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) have been met with respect to the system, and

(B) with respect to that system a waiver of certain requirements of this subchapter has been approved on or before (and which is in effect as of) April 20, 1983, pursuant to section 1395b–1(a) of this title or section 222(a) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972.

With respect to a State system described in this paragraph, the Secretary shall judge the effectiveness of such system on the basis of its rate of increase or inflation in inpatient hospital payments for individuals under this subchapter, as compared to the national rate of increase or inflation for such payments, with the State retaining the option to have the test applied on the basis of the aggregate payments under the State system as compared to aggregate payments which would have been made under the national system since October 1, 1984, to the most recent date for which annual data are available.

(5) The Secretary shall approve the request of a State under paragraph (1) with respect to a hospital reimbursement control system if-

(A) the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) have been met with respect to the system;

(B) the Secretary determines that the system-

(i) is operated directly by the State or by an entity designated pursuant to State law,

(ii) provides for payment of hospitals covered under the system under a methodology (which sets forth exceptions and adjustments, as well as any method for changes in the methodology) by which rates or amounts to be paid for hospital services during a specified period are established under the system prior to the defined rate period, and

(iii) hospitals covered under the system will make such reports (in lieu of cost and other reports, identified by the Secretary, otherwise required under this subchapter) as the Secretary may require in order to properly monitor assurances provided under this subsection;

(C) the State has provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that operation of the system will not result in any change in hospital admission practices which result in-

(i) a significant reduction in the proportion of patients (receiving hospital services covered under the system) who have no third-party coverage and who are unable to pay for hospital services,

(ii) a significant reduction in the proportion of individuals admitted to hospitals for inpatient hospital services for which payment is (or is likely to be) less than the anticipated charges for or costs of such services,

(iii) the refusal to admit patients who would be expected to require unusually costly or prolonged treatment for reasons other than those related to the appropriateness of the care available at the hospital, or

(iv) the refusal to provide emergency services to any person who is in need of emergency services if the hospital provides such services;

(D) any change by the State in the system which has the effect of materially reducing payments to hospitals can only take effect upon 60 days notice to the Secretary and to the hospitals the payment to which is likely to be materially affected by the change; and

(E) the State has provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that in the development of the system the State has consulted with local governmental officials concerning the impact of the system on public hospitals.

The Secretary shall respond to requests of States under this paragraph within 60 days of the date the request is submitted to the Secretary.

(6) If the Secretary determines that the assurances described in paragraph (1)(C) have not been met with respect to any 36-month period, the Secretary may reduce payments under this subchapter to hospitals under the system in an amount equal to the amount by which the payment under this subchapter under such system for such period exceeded the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system.

(7) In the case of a State which made a request under paragraph (5) before December 31, 1984, for the approval of a State hospital reimbursement control system and which request was approved-

(A) in applying paragraphs (1)(C) and (6), a reference to a “36-month period” is deemed a reference to a “48-month period”, and

(B) in order to allow the State the opportunity to provide the assurances described in paragraph (1)(C) for a 48-month period, the Secretary may not discontinue payments under the system, under the authority of paragraph (3)(A) because the Secretary has reason to believe that such assurances are not being (or will not be) met, before July 1, 1986.
(d) Inpatient hospital service payments on basis of prospective rates; Medicare Geographical Classification Review Board

(1)(A) Notwithstanding section 1395f(b) of this title but subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, the amount of the payment with respect to the operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section) of a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in subparagraph (B)) for inpatient hospital discharges in a cost reporting period or in a fiscal year-

(i) beginning on or after October 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1984, is equal to the sum of-

(I) the target percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(A) of this section, but determined without the application of subsection (a) of this section), and

(II) the DRG percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under paragraph (2) for such discharges;

(ii) beginning on or after October 1, 1984, and before October 1, 1987, is equal to the sum of-

(I) the target percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(A) of this section, but determined without the application of subsection (a) of this section), and

(II) the DRG percentage (as defined in subparagraph (C)) of the applicable combined adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under subparagraph (D) for such discharges; or

(iii) beginning on or after April 1, 1988, is equal to-

(I) the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under paragraph (3) for such discharges, or

(II) for discharges occurring during a fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1996, the sum of 85 percent of the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under paragraph (3) for such discharges and 15 percent of the regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate determined under such paragraph, but only if the average standardized amount (described in clause (i)(I) or clause (ii)(I) of paragraph (3)(D)) for hospitals within the region of, and in the same large urban or other area (or, for discharges occurring during a fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1994, the same large urban or other area) as, the hospital is greater than the average standardized amount (described in the respective clause) for hospitals within the United States in that type of area for discharges occurring during such fiscal year.

(B) As used in this section, the term “subsection (d) hospital” means a hospital located in one of the fifty States or the District of Columbia other than-

(i) a psychiatric hospital (as defined in section 1395x(f) of this title),

(ii) a rehabilitation hospital (as defined by the Secretary),

(iii) a hospital whose inpatients are predominantly individuals under 18 years of age,

and, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, does not include a psychiatric or rehabilitation unit of the hospital which is a distinct part of the hospital (as defined by the Secretary).

(C) For purposes of this subsection, for cost reporting periods beginning-

(i) on or after October 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1984, the “target percentage” is 75 percent and the “DRG percentage” is 25 percent;

(ii) on or after October 1, 1984, and before October 1, 1985, the “target percentage” is 50 percent and the “DRG percentage” is 50 percent;

(iii) on or after October 1, 1985, and before October 1, 1986, the “target percentage” is 45 percent and the “DRG percentage” is 55 percent; and

(iv) on or after October 1, 1986, and before October 1, 1987, the “target percentage” is 25 percent and the “DRG percentage” is 75 percent.

(D) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), the “applicable combined adjusted DRG prospective payment rate” for discharges occurring-

(i) on or after October 1, 1984, and before October 1, 1986, is a combined rate consisting of 25 percent of the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, and 75 percent of the regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, determined under paragraph (3) for such discharges; and

(ii) on or after October 1, 1986, and before October 1, 1987, is a combined rate consisting of 50 percent of the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, and 50 percent of the regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, determined under paragraph (3) for such discharges.

(2) The Secretary shall determine a national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge in fiscal year 1984 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) hospital in the United States, and shall determine a regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate for such discharges in each region, for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Each such rate shall be determined for hospitals located in urban or rural areas within the United States or within each such region, respectively, as follows:

(A) The Secretary shall determine the allowable operating costs per discharge of inpatient hospital services for the hospital for the most recent cost reporting period for which data are available.

(B) The Secretary shall update each amount determined under subparagraph (A) for fiscal year 1984 by-

(i) updating for fiscal year 1983 by the estimated average rate of change of hospital costs industry-wide between the cost reporting period used under such subparagraph and fiscal year 1983 and the most recent case-mix data available, and

(ii) projecting for fiscal year 1984 by the applicable percentage increase (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section) for fiscal year 1984.

(C) The Secretary shall standardize the amount updated under subparagraph (B) for each hospital by-

(i) excluding an estimate of indirect medical education costs (taking into account, for discharges occurring after September 30, 1986, the amendments made by section 9104(a) of the Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1985),

(ii) adjusting for variations among hospitals by area in the average hospital wage level,

(iii) adjusting for variations in case mix among hospitals, and

(iv) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, excluding an estimate of the additional payments to certain hospitals to be made under paragraph (5)(F), except that the Secretary shall not exclude additional payments under such paragraph made as a result of the enactment of section 6003(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 or the enactment of section 4002(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.

(D) The Secretary shall compute an average of the standardized amounts determined under subparagraph (C) for the United States and for each region-

(i) for all subsection (d) hospitals located in an urban area within the United States or that region, respectively, and

(ii) for all subsection (d) hospitals located in a rural area within the United States or that region, respectively.

For purposes of this subsection, the term “region” means one of the nine census divisions, comprising the fifty States and the District of Columbia, established by the Bureau of the Census for statistical and reporting purposes; the term “urban area” means an area within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget) or within such similar area as the Secretary has recognized under subsection (a) of this section by regulation; the term “large urban area” means, with respect to a fiscal year, such an urban area which the Secretary determines (in the publications described in subsection (e)(5) of this section before the fiscal year) has a population of more than 1,000,000 (as determined by the Secretary based on the most recent available population data published by the Bureau of the Census); and the term “rural area” means any area outside such an area or similar area. A hospital located in a Metropolitan Statistical Area shall be deemed to be located in the region in which the largest number of the hospitals in the same Metropolitan Statistical Area are located, or, at the option of the Secretary, the region in which the majority of the inpatient discharges (with respect to which payments are made under this subchapter) from hospitals in the same Metropolitan Statistical Area are made.

(E) The Secretary shall reduce each of the average standardized amounts determined under subparagraph (D) by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by the Secretary) of the amount of payments under this subsection based on DRG prospective payment rates which are additional payments described in paragraph (5)(A) (relating to outlier payments).

(F) The Secretary shall adjust each of such average standardized amounts as may be required under subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section for that fiscal year.

(G) For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group, the Secretary shall establish a national DRG prospective payment rate and shall establish a regional DRG prospective payment rate for each region, each of which is equal-

(i) for hospitals located in an urban area in the United States or that region (respectively), to the product of-

(I) the average standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (D), reduced under subparagraph (E), and adjusted under subparagraph (F)) for hospitals located in an urban area in the United States or that region, and

(II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group; and

(ii) for hospitals located in a rural area in the United States or that region (respectively), to the product of-

(I) the average standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (D), reduced under subparagraph (E), and adjusted under subparagraph (F)) for hospitals located in a rural area in the United States or that region, and

(II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group.

(H) The Secretary shall adjust the proportion, (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals’ costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the national and regional DRG prospective payment rates computed under subparagraph (G) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.

(3) The Secretary shall determine a national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge in a fiscal year after fiscal year 1984 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) hospital in the United States, and shall determine a regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate for such discharges in each region for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Each such rate shall be determined for hospitals located in large urban, other urban, or rural areas within the United States and within each such region, respectively, as follows:

(A)(i) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1987, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in an urban area and for hospitals located in a rural area within the United States and for hospitals located in an urban area and for hospitals located in a rural area within each region, equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under paragraph (2)(D) or under this subparagraph, increased for the fiscal year involved by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section. With respect to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1987, the Secretary shall compute urban and rural averages on the basis of discharge weighting rather than hospital weighting, making appropriate adjustments to ensure that computation on such basis does not result in total payments under this section that are greater or less than the total payments that would have been made under this section but for this sentence, and making appropriate changes in the manner of determining the reductions under subparagraph (C)(ii).

(ii) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1987, and ending on or before September 30, 1994, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in a large urban area, for hospitals located in a rural area, and for hospitals located in other urban areas, within the United States and within each region, equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under this subparagraph increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section with respect to hospitals located in the respective areas for the fiscal year involved.

(iii) For discharges occurring in the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1994, the average standardized amount for hospitals located in a rural area shall be equal to the average standardized amount for hospitals located in an other 4 urban area. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, the Secretary shall adjust the ratio of the labor portion to non-labor portion of each average standardized amount to equal such ratio for the national average of all standardized amounts.

(iv) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1995, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in a large urban area and for hospitals located in other areas within the United States and within each region equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under this subparagraph increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section with respect to hospitals located in the respective areas for the fiscal year involved.

(v) Average standardized amounts computed under this paragraph shall be adjusted to reflect the most recent case-mix data available.

(B) The Secretary shall reduce each of the average standardized amounts determined under subparagraph (A) by a factor equal to the proportion of payments under this subsection (as estimated by the Secretary) based on DRG prospective payment amounts which are additional payments described in paragraph (5)(A) (relating to outlier payments).

(C)(i) For discharges occurring in fiscal year 1985, the Secretary shall adjust each of such average standardized amounts as may be required under subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section for that fiscal year.

(ii) For discharges occurring after September 30, 1986, the Secretary shall further reduce each of the average standardized amounts (in a proportion which takes into account the differing effects of the standardization effected under paragraph (2)(C)(i)) so as to provide for a reduction in the total of the payments (attributable to this paragraph) made for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, of an amount equal to the estimated reduction in the payment amounts under paragraph (5)(B) that would have resulted from the enactment of the amendments made by section 9104 of the Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1985 and by section 4003(a)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 if the factor described in clause (ii)(II) of paragraph (5)(B) (determined without regard to amendments made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) were applied for discharges occurring on or after such date instead of the factor described in clause (ii) of that paragraph.

(D) For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group, the Secretary shall establish for the fiscal year a national DRG prospective payment rate and shall establish a regional DRG prospective payment rate for each region, each of which is equal-

(i) for hospitals located in a large urban area in the United States or that region (respectively), to the product of-

(I) the average standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (A), reduced under subparagraph (B), and adjusted or reduced under subparagraph (C)) for the fiscal year for hospitals located in such a large urban area in the United States or that region, and

(II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group; and

(ii) for hospitals located in other areas in the United States or that region (respectively), to the product of-

(I) the average standardized amount (computed under subparagraph (A), reduced under subparagraph (B), and adjusted or reduced under subparagraph (C)) for the fiscal year for hospitals located in other areas in the United States or that region, and

(II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group.

(E) The Secretary shall adjust the proportion, (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals’ costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the DRG prospective payment rates computed under subparagraph (D) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level. Not later than October 1, 1990, and October 1, 1993 (and at least every 12 months thereafter), the Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of a survey conducted by the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs of subsection (d) hospitals in the United States. To the extent determined feasible by the Secretary, such survey shall measure the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category and shall exclude data with respect to the wages and wage-related costs incurred in furnishing skilled nursing facility services. Any adjustments or updates made under this subparagraph for a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1991) shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate payments under this subsection in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made in the year without such adjustment.

(4)(A) The Secretary shall establish a classification of inpatient hospital discharges by diagnosis-related groups and a methodology for classifying specific hospital discharges within these groups.

(B) For each such diagnosis-related group the Secretary shall assign an appropriate weighting factor which reflects the relative hospital resources used with respect to discharges classified within that group compared to discharges classified within other groups.

(C)(i) The Secretary shall adjust the classifications and weighting factors established under subparagraphs (A) and (B), for discharges in fiscal year 1988 and at least annually thereafter, to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, and other factors which may change the relative use of hospital resources.

(ii) For discharges in fiscal year 1990, the Secretary shall reduce the weighting factor for each diagnosis-related group by 1.22 percent.

(iii) Any such adjustment under clause (i) for discharges in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1991) shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate payments under this subsection for discharges in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made for discharges in the year without such adjustment.

(iv) The Secretary shall include recommendations with respect to adjustments to weighting factors under clause (i) in the annual report to Congress required under subsection (e)(3)(B) of this section.

(5)(A)(i) For discharges occurring during fiscal years ending on or before September 30, 1997, the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for a subsection (d) hospital for any discharge in a diagnosis-related group, the length of stay of which exceeds the mean length of stay for discharges within that group by a fixed number of days, or exceeds such mean length of stay by some fixed number of standard deviations, whichever is the fewer number of days.

(ii) For cases which are not included in clause (i), a subsection (d) hospital may request additional payments in any case where charges, adjusted to cost, exceed a fixed multiple of the applicable DRG prospective payment rate, or exceed such other fixed dollar amount, whichever is greater, or, for discharges in fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1994, exceed the applicable DRG prospective payment rate plus a fixed dollar amount determined by the Secretary.

(iii) The amount of such additional payment under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall (except as payments under clause (i) are required to be reduced to take into account the requirements of clause (v)) approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the cutoff point applicable under clause (i) or (ii).

(iv) The total amount of the additional payments made under this subparagraph for discharges in a fiscal year may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 6 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on DRG prospective payment rates for discharges in that year.

(v) The Secretary shall provide that-

(I) the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1995 shall be 75 percent of the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1994;

(II) the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1996 shall be 50 percent of the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1994; and

(III) the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1997 shall be 25 percent of the day outlier percentage for fiscal year 1994.

(vi) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “day outlier percentage” means, for a fiscal year, the percentage of the total additional payments made by the Secretary under this subparagraph for discharges in that fiscal year which are additional payments under clause (i).

(B) The Secretary shall provide for an additional payment amount for subsection (d) hospitals with indirect costs of medical education, in an amount computed in the same manner as the adjustment for such costs under regulations (in effect as of January 1, 1983) under subsection (a)(2) of this section, except as follows:

(i) The amount of such additional payment shall be determined by multiplying (I) the sum of the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii)(II) (or, if applicable, the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii)) and the amount paid to the hospital under subparagraph (A), by (II) the indirect teaching adjustment factor described in clause (ii).

(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(II), the indirect teaching adjustment factor for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1988, is equal to 1.89 × (((1 + r) to the nth power) −1), where “r” is the ratio of the hospital's full-time equivalent interns and residents to beds and “n” equals .405.

(iii) In determining such adjustment the Secretary shall not distinguish between those interns and residents who are employees of a hospital and those interns and residents who furnish services to a hospital but are not employees of such hospital.

(iv) In determining such adjustment, the Secretary shall continue to count interns and residents assigned to outpatient services of the hospital or providing services at any entity receiving a grant under section 254c of this title that is under the ownership or control of the hospital (if the hospital incurs all, or substantially all, of the costs of the services furnished by such interns and residents) as part of the calculation of the full-time-equivalent number of interns and residents.

(C)(i) The Secretary shall provide for such exceptions and adjustments to the payment amounts established under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the special needs of regional and national referral centers (including those hospitals of 275 or more beds located in rural areas). A hospital which is classified as a rural hospital may appeal to the Secretary to be classified as a rural referral center under this clause on the basis of criteria (established by the Secretary) which shall allow the hospital to demonstrate that it should be so reclassified by reason of certain of its operating characteristics being similar to those of a typical urban hospital located in the same census region and which shall not require a rural osteopathic hospital to have more than 3,000 discharges in a year in order to be classified as a rural referral center. Such characteristics may include wages, scope of services, service area, and the mix of medical specialties. The Secretary shall publish the criteria not later than August 17, 1984, for implementation by October 1, 1984. An appeal allowed under this clause must be submitted to the Secretary (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe) during the quarter before the first quarter of the hospital's cost reporting period (or, in the case of a cost reporting period beginning during October 1984, during the first quarter of that period), and the Secretary must make a final determination with respect to such appeal within 60 days after the date the appeal was submitted. Any payment adjustments necessitated by a reclassification based upon the appeal shall be effective at the beginning of such cost reporting period.

(ii) The Secretary shall provide, under clause (i), for the classification of a rural hospital as a regional referral center if the hospital has a case mix index equal to or greater than the median case mix index for hospitals (other than hospitals with approved teaching programs) located in an urban area in the same region (as defined in paragraph (2)(D)), has at least 5,000 discharges a year or, if less, the median number of discharges in urban hospitals in the region in which the hospital is located (or, in the case of a rural osteopathic hospital, meets the criterion established by the Secretary under clause (i) with respect to the annual number of discharges for such hospitals), and meets any other criteria established by the Secretary under clause (i).

(D)(i) For any cost reporting period beginning on or after April 1, 1990, with respect to a subsection (d) hospital which is a sole community hospital, payment under paragraph (1)(A) shall be-

(I) an amount based on 100 percent of the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period, as defined in subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section, or

(II) the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii),

whichever results in greater payment to the hospital.

(ii) In the case of a sole community hospital that experiences, in a cost reporting period compared to the previous cost reporting period, a decrease of more than 5 percent in its total number of inpatient cases due to circumstances beyond its control, the Secretary shall provide for such adjustment to the payment amounts under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as may be necessary to fully compensate the hospital for the fixed costs it incurs in the period in providing inpatient hospital services, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.

(iii) For purposes of this subchapter, the term “sole community hospital” means any hospital-

(I) that the Secretary determines is located more than 35 road miles from another hospital,

(II) that, by reason of factors such as the time required for an individual to travel to the nearest alternative source of appropriate inpatient care (in accordance with standards promulgated by the Secretary), location, weather conditions, travel conditions, or absence of other like hospitals (as determined by the Secretary), is the sole source of inpatient hospital services reasonably available to individuals in a geographic area who are entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, or

(III) that is located in a rural area and designated by the Secretary as an essential access community hospital under section 1395i–4(i)(1) of this title.

(iv) The Secretary shall promulgate a standard for determining whether a hospital meets the criteria for classification as a sole community hospital under clause (iii)(II) because of the time required for an individual to travel to the nearest alternative source of appropriate inpatient care.

(v) If the Secretary determines that, in the case of a hospital located in a rural area and designated by the Secretary as an essential access community hospital under section 1395i–4(i)(1) of this title, the hospital has incurred increases in reasonable costs during a cost reporting period as a result of becoming a member of a rural health network (as defined in section 1395i–4(g) of this title) in the State in which it is located, and in incurring such increases, the hospital will increase its costs for subsequent cost reporting periods, the Secretary shall increase the hospital's target amount under subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section to account for such incurred increases.

(E)(i) The Secretary shall estimate the amount of reimbursement made for services described in section 1395y(a)(14) of this title with respect to which payment was made under part B of this subchapter in the base reporting periods referred to in paragraph (2)(A) and with respect to which payment is no longer being made.

(ii) The Secretary shall provide for an adjustment to the payment for subsection (d) hospitals in each fiscal year so as appropriately to reflect the net amount described in clause (i).

(F)(i) For discharges occurring on or after May 1, 1986, the Secretary shall provide, in accordance with this subparagraph, for an additional payment amount for each subsection (d) hospital which-

(I) serves a significantly disproportionate number of low-income patients (as defined in clause (v)), or

(II) is located in an urban area, has 100 or more beds, and can demonstrate that its net inpatient care revenues (excluding any of such revenues attributable to this subchapter or State plans approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter), during the cost reporting period in which the discharges occur, for indigent care from State and local government sources exceed 30 percent of its total of such net inpatient care revenues during the period.

(ii) The amount of such payment for each discharge shall be determined by multiplying (I) the sum of the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii)(II) (or, if applicable, the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii)) and the amount paid to the hospital under subparagraph (A) for that discharge, by (II) the disproportionate share adjustment percentage established under clause (iii) or (iv) for the cost reporting period in which the discharge occurs.

(iii) The disproportionate share adjustment percentage for a cost reporting period for a hospital described in clause (i)(II) is equal to 35 percent.

(iv) The disproportionate share adjustment percentage for a cost reporting period for a hospital that is not described in clause (i)(II) and that-

(I) is located in an urban area and has 100 or more beds or is described in the second sentence of clause (v), is equal to the percent determined in accordance with the applicable formula described in clause (vii);

(II) is located in an urban area and has less than 100 beds, is equal to 5 percent;

(III) is located in a rural area and is not described in subclause (IV) or (V) or in the second sentence of clause (v), is equal to 4 percent;

(IV) is located in a rural area, is classified as a rural referral center under subparagraph (C), and is classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D), is equal to 10 percent or, if greater, the percent determined in accordance with the applicable formula described in clause (viii);

(V) is located in a rural area, is classified as a rural referral center under subparagraph (C), and is not classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D), is equal to the percent determined in accordance with the applicable formula described in clause (viii); or

(VI) is located in a rural area, is classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D), and is not classified as a rural referral center under subparagraph (C), is 10 percent.

(v) In this subparagraph, a hospital “serves a significantly disproportionate number of low income patients” for a cost reporting period if the hospital has a disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)) for that period which equals, or exceeds-

(I) 15 percent, if the hospital is located in an urban area and has 100 or more beds,

(II) 30 percent, if the hospital is located in a rural area and has more than 100 beds, or is located in a rural area and is classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D),

(III) 40 percent, if the hospital is located in an urban area and has less than 100 beds, or

(IV) 45 percent, if the hospital is located in a rural area and is not described in subclause (II).

A hospital located in a rural area and with 500 or more beds also “serves a significantly disproportionate number of low income patients” for a cost reporting period if the hospital has a disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)) for that period which equals or exceeds a percentage specified by the Secretary.

(vi) In this subparagraph, the term “disproportionate patient percentage” means, with respect to a cost reporting period of a hospital, the sum of-

(I) the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of such hospital's patient days for such period which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter and were entitled to supplementary security income benefits (excluding any State supplementation) under subchapter XVI of this chapter, and the denominator of which is the number of such hospital's patient days for such fiscal year which were made up of patients who (for such days) were entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and

(II) the fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the number of the hospital's patient days for such period which consist of patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter, but who were not entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital's patient days for such period.

(vii) The formula used to determine the disproportionate share adjustment percentage for a cost reporting period for a hospital described in clause (iv)(I) is-

(I) in the case of such a hospital with a disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)) greater than 20.2-

(a) for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1990, and on or before December 31, 1990, (P−20.2)(.65) + 5.62,

(b) for discharges occurring on or after January 1, 1991, and on or before September 30, 1993, (P−20.2)(.7) + 5.62,

(c) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1993, and on or before September 30, 1994, (P−20.2)(.8) + 5.88, and

(d) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, (P−20.2)(.825) + 5.88; or

(II) in the case of any other such hospital-

(a) for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 1990, and on or before December 31, 1990, (P−15)(.6) + 2.5,

(b) for discharges occurring on or after January 1, 1991, and on or before September 30, 1993, (P−15)(.6) + 2.5,5

(c) for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1993, (P−15)(.65) + 2.5,

where “P” is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)).

(viii) The formula used to determine the disproportionate share adjustment percentage for a cost reporting period for a hospital described in clause (iv)(IV) or (iv)(V) is the percentage determined in accordance with the following formula: (P^30)(.6)+4.0, where “P” is the hospital's disproportionate patient percentage (as defined in clause (vi)).

(G)(i) For any cost reporting period beginning on or after April 1, 1990, and before October 1, 1994, in the case of a subsection (d) hospital which is a medicare-dependent, small rural hospital, payment under paragraph (1)(A) shall be equal to the sum of the amount determined under clause (ii) and the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii).

(ii) The amount determined under this clause is-

(I) for discharges occurring during the 36-month period beginning with the first day of the cost reporting period that begins on or after April 1, 1990, the amount by which the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(D) of this section) exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii); and

(II) for discharges occurring during any subsequent cost reporting period (or portion thereof) and before October 1, 1994, 50 percent of the amount by which the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(D) of this section) exceeds the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii).

(iii) In the case of a medicare dependent, small rural hospital that experiences, in a cost reporting period compared to the previous cost reporting period, a decrease of more than 5 percent in its total number of inpatient cases due to circumstances beyond its control, the Secretary shall provide for such adjustment to the payment amounts under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as may be necessary to fully compensate the hospital for the fixed costs it incurs in the period in providing inpatient hospital services, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.

(iv) The term “medicare-dependent, small rural hospital” means, with respect to any cost reporting period to which clause (i) applies, any hospital-

(I) located in a rural area,

(II) that has not more than 100 beds,

(III) that is not classified as a sole community hospital under subparagraph (D), and

(IV) for which not less than 60 percent of its inpatient days or discharges during the cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1987 were attributable to inpatients entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter.

(H) The Secretary may provide for such adjustments to the payment amounts under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the unique circumstances of hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii.

(I)(i) The Secretary shall provide by regulation for such other exceptions and adjustments to such payment amounts under this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate.

(ii) In making adjustments under clause (i) for transfer cases (as defined by the Secretary) in a fiscal year, the Secretary may make adjustments to each of the average standardized amounts determined under paragraph (3) to assure that the aggregate payments made under this subsection for such fiscal year are not greater or lesser than those that would have otherwise been made in such fiscal year.

(6) The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, on or before the September 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1984), of a description of the methodology and data used in computing the adjusted DRG prospective payment rates under this subsection, including any adjustments required under subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section.

(7) There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395oo of this title or otherwise of-

(A) the determination of the requirement, or the proportional amount, of any adjustment effected pursuant to subsection (e)(1) of this section, and

(B) the establishment of diagnosis-related groups, of the methodology for the classification of discharges within such groups, and of the appropriate weighting factors thereof under paragraph (4).

(8)(A) In the case of any hospital which is located in an area which is, at any time after April 20, 1983, reclassified from an urban to a rural area, payments to such hospital for the first two cost reporting periods for which such reclassification is effective shall be made as follows:

(i) For the first such cost reporting period, payment shall be equal to the amount payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of the rural classification, plus an amount equal to two-thirds of the amount (if any) by which-

(I) the amount which would have been payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of an urban classification, exceeds

(II) the amount payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of the rural classification.

(ii) For the second such cost reporting period, payment shall be equal to the amount payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of the rural classification, plus an amount equal to one-third of the amount (if any) by which-

(I) the amount which would have been payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of an urban classification, exceeds

(II) the amount payable to such hospital for such reporting period on the basis of the rural classification.

(B) For purposes of this subsection, the Secretary shall treat a hospital located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas as being located in the urban metropolitan statistical area to which the greatest number of workers in the county commute, if the rural county would otherwise be considered part of an urban area, under the standards for designating Metropolitan Statistical Areas (and for designating New England County Metropolitan Areas) published in the Federal Register on January 3, 1980, if the commuting rates used in determining outlying counties (or, for New England, similar recognized areas) were determined on the basis of the aggregate number of resident workers who commute to (and, if applicable under the standards, from) the central county or counties of all contiguous Metropolitan Statistical Areas (or New England County Metropolitan Areas).

(C)(i) If the application of subparagraph (B) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or the Secretary under paragraph (10), by treating hospitals located in a rural county or counties as being located in an urban area, or by treating hospitals located in one urban area as being located in another urban area-

(I) reduces the wage index for that urban area (as applied under this subsection) by 1 percentage point or less, the Secretary, in calculating such wage index under this subsection, shall exclude those hospitals so treated, or

(II) reduces the wage index for that urban area by more than 1 percentage point (as applied under this subsection), the Secretary shall calculate and apply such wage index under this subsection separately to hospitals located in such urban area (excluding all the hospitals so treated) and to the hospitals so treated (as if such hospitals were located in such urban area).

(ii) If the application of subparagraph (B) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or the Secretary under paragraph (10), by treating hospitals located in a rural county or counties as not being located in the rural area in a State, reduces the wage index for that rural area (as applied under this subsection), the Secretary shall calculate and apply such wage index under this subsection as if the hospitals so treated had not been excluded from calculation of the wage index for that rural area.

(iii) The application of subparagraph (B) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or the Secretary under paragraph (10) may not result in the reduction of any county's wage index to a level below the wage index for rural areas in the State in which the county is located.

(iv) The application of subparagraph (B) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or of the Secretary under paragraph (10) may not result in a reduction in an urban area's wage index if-

(I) the urban area has a wage index below the wage index for rural areas in the State in which it is located; or

(II) the urban area is located in a State that is composed of a single urban area.

(v) This subparagraph shall apply with respect to discharges occurring in a fiscal year only if the Secretary uses a method for making adjustments to the DRG prospective payment rate for area differences in hospital wage levels under paragraph (3)(E) for the fiscal year that is based on the use of Metropolitan Statistical Area classifications.

(D) The Secretary shall make a proportional adjustment in the standardized amounts determined under paragraph (3) to assure that the provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C) or a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board or the Secretary under paragraph (10) do not result in aggregate payments under this section that are greater or less than those that would otherwise be made.

(9)(A) Notwithstanding section 1395f(b) of this title but subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, the amount of the payment with respect to the operating costs of inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital for inpatient hospital discharges in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1987, is equal to the sum of-

(i) 75 percent of the Puerto Rico adjusted DRG prospective payment rate (determined under subparagraph (B) or (C)) for such discharges, and

(ii) 25 percent of the discharge-weighted average of-

(I) the national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate (determined under paragraph (3)(D)) for hospitals located in a large urban area,

(II) such rate for hospitals located in other urban areas, and

(III) such rate for hospitals located in a rural area,

for such discharges, adjusted in the manner provided in paragraph (3)(E) for different area wage levels. As used in this section, the term “subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital” means a hospital that is located in Puerto Rico and that would be a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in paragraph (1)(B)) if it were located in one of the fifty States.

(B) The Secretary shall determine a Puerto Rico adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge in fiscal year 1988 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Such rate shall be determined for such hospitals located in urban or rural areas within Puerto Rico, as follows:

(i) The Secretary shall determine the target amount (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(A) of this section) for the hospital for the cost reporting period beginning in fiscal year 1987 and increase such amount by prorating the applicable percentage increase (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section) to update the amount to the midpoint in fiscal year 1988.

(ii) The Secretary shall standardize the amount determined under clause (i) for each hospital by-

(I) excluding an estimate of indirect medical education costs,

(II) adjusting for variations among hospitals by area in the average hospital wage level,

(III) adjusting for variations in case mix among hospitals, and

(IV) excluding an estimate of the additional payments to certain subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals to be made under subparagraph (D)(iii) (relating to disproportionate share payments).

(iii) The Secretary shall compute a discharge weighted average of the standardized amounts determined under clause (ii) for all hospitals located in an urban area and for all hospitals located in a rural area (as such terms are defined in paragraph (2)(D)).

(iv) The Secretary shall reduce the average standardized amount by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by the Secretary) of the amount of payments under this paragraph which are additional payments described in subparagraph (D)(i) (relating to outlier payments).

(v) For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group for hospitals located in an urban or rural area, respectively, the Secretary shall establish a Puerto Rico DRG prospective payment rate equal to the product of-

(I) the average standardized amount (computed under clause (iii) and reduced under clause (iv)) for hospitals located in an urban or rural area, respectively, and

(II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group.

(vi) The Secretary shall adjust the proportion (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals’ costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the Puerto Rico DRG prospective payment rate computed under clause (v) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the Puerto Rican average hospital wage level.

(C) The Secretary shall determine a Puerto Rico adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge after fiscal year 1988 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Such rate shall be determined for hospitals located in urban or rural areas within Puerto Rico as follows:

(i) The Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in an urban area and for hospitals located in a rural area equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under subparagraph (B)(iii) or under this clause, increased for fiscal year 1989 by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, and adjusted for subsequent fiscal years in accordance with the final determination of the Secretary under subsection (e)(4) of this section, and adjusted to reflect the most recent case-mix data available.

(ii) The Secretary shall reduce each of the average standardized amounts by a proportion equal to the proportion (estimated by the Secretary) of the amount of payments under this paragraph which are additional payments described in subparagraph (D)(i) (relating to outlier payments).

(iii) For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group for hospitals located in an urban or rural area, respectively, the Secretary shall establish a Puerto Rico DRG prospective payment rate equal to the product of-

(I) the average standardized amount (computed under clause (i) and reduced under clause (ii)) for hospitals located in an urban or rural area, respectively, and

(II) the weighting factor (determined under paragraph (4)(B)) for that diagnosis-related group.

(iv) The Secretary shall adjust the proportion (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of hospitals’ costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the Puerto Rico DRG prospective payment rate computed under clause (iii) for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the Puerto Rico average hospital wage level. The second and third sentences of paragraph (3)(E) shall apply to subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals under this clause in the same manner as they apply to subsection (d) hospitals under such paragraph and, for purposes of this clause, any reference in such paragraph to a subsection (d) hospital is deemed a reference to a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital.

(D) The following provisions of paragraph (5) shall apply to subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals receiving payment under this paragraph in the same manner and to the extent as they apply to subsection (d) hospitals receiving payment under this subsection:

(i) Subparagraph (A) (relating to outlier payments).

(ii) Subparagraph (B) (relating to payments for indirect medical education costs), except that for this purpose the sum of the amount determined under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the amount paid to the hospital under clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be substituted for the sum referred to in paragraph (5)(B)(i)(I).

(iii) Subparagraph (F) (relating to disproportionate share payments), except that for this purpose the sum described in clause (ii) of this subparagraph shall be substituted for the sum referred to in paragraph (5)(F)(ii)(I).

(iv) Subparagraph (H) (relating to exceptions and adjustments).

(10)(A) There is hereby established the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “Board”).

(B)(i) The Board shall be composed of 5 members appointed by the Secretary without regard to the provisions of title 5, governing appointments in the competitive service. Two of such members shall be representative of subsection (d) hospitals located in a rural area under paragraph (2)(D).

(ii) The Secretary shall make initial appointments to the Board as provided in this paragraph within 180 days after December 19, 1989.

(C)(i) The Board shall consider the application of any subsection (d) hospital requesting that the Secretary change the hospital's geographic classification for purposes of determining for a fiscal year-

(I) the hospital's average standardized amount under paragraph (2)(D), or

(II) the factor used to adjust the DRG prospective payment rate for area differences in hospital wage levels that applies to such hospital under paragraph (3)(E).

(ii) A hospital requesting a change in geographic classification under clause (i) for a fiscal year shall submit its application to the Board not later than the first day of the preceding fiscal year.

(iii)(I) The Board shall render a decision on an application submitted under clause (i) not later than 180 days after the deadline referred to in clause (ii).

(II) Appeal of decisions of the Board shall be subject to the provisions of section 557b 6 of title 5. The Secretary shall issue a decision on such an appeal not later than 90 days after the date on which the appeal is filed. The decision of the Secretary shall be final and shall not be subject to judicial review.

(D)(i) The Secretary shall publish guidelines to be utilized by the Board in rendering decisions on applications submitted under this paragraph, and shall include in such guidelines the following:

(I) Guidelines for comparing wages, taking into account (to the extent the Secretary determines appropriate) occupational mix, in the area in which the hospital is classified and the area in which the hospital is applying to be classified.

(II) Guidelines for determining whether the county in which the hospital is located should be treated as being a part of a particular Metropolitan Statistical Area.

(III) Guidelines for considering information provided by an applicant with respect to the effects of the hospital's geographic classification on access to inpatient hospital services by medicare beneficiaries.

(IV) Guidelines for considering the appropriateness of the criteria used to define New England County Metropolitan Areas.

(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if the Secretary uses a method for making adjustments to the DRG prospective payment rate for area differences in hospital wage levels under paragraph (3)(E) that is not based on the use of Metropolitan Statistical Area classifications, the Secretary may revise the guidelines published under clause (i) to the extent such guidelines are used to determine the appropriateness of the geographic area in which the hospital is determined to be located for purposes of making such adjustments.

(iii) The Secretary shall publish the guidelines described in clause (i) by July 1, 1990.

(E)(i) The Board shall have full power and authority to make rules and establish procedures, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter or regulations of the Secretary, which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this paragraph. In the course of any hearing the Board may administer oaths and affirmations. The provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of section 405 of this title with respect to subpenas shall apply to the Board to the same extent as such provisions apply to the Secretary with respect to subchapter II of this chapter.

(ii) The Board is authorized to engage such technical assistance and to receive such information as may be required to carry out its functions, and the Secretary shall, in addition, make available to the Board such secretarial, clerical, and other assistance as the Board may require to carry out its functions.

(F)(i) Each member of the Board who is not an officer or employee of the Federal Government shall be compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay prescribed for grade GS–18 of the General Schedule under section 5332 of title 5 for each day (including travel time) during which such member is engaged in the performance of the duties of the Board. Each member of the Board who is an officer or employee of the United States shall serve without compensation in addition to that received for service as an officer or employee of the United States.

(ii) Members of the Board shall be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, at rates authorized for employees of agencies under subchapter I of chapter 57 of title 5, while away from their homes or regular places of business in the performance of services for the Board.
(e) Proportional adjustments in applicable percentage increases; Prospective Payment Assessment Commission

(1)(A) For cost reporting periods of hospitals beginning in fiscal year 1984 or fiscal year 1985, the Secretary shall provide for such proportional adjustment in the applicable percentage increase (otherwise applicable to the periods under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section) as may be necessary to assure that-

(i) the aggregate payment amounts otherwise provided under subsection (d)(1)(A)(i)(I) of this section for that fiscal year for operating costs of inpatient hospital services of hospitals (excluding payments made under section 1395cc(a)(1)(F) of this title),

are not greater or less than-

(ii) the target percentage (as defined in subsection (d)(1)(C) of this section) of the payment amounts which would have been payable for such services for those same hospitals for that fiscal year under this section under the law as in effect before April 20, 1983 (excluding payments made under section 1395cc(a)(1)(F) of this title);

except that the adjustment made under this subparagraph shall apply only to subsection (d) hospitals and shall not apply for purposes of making computations under subsection (d)(2)(B)(ii) of this section or subsection (d)(3)(A) of this section.

(B) For discharges occurring in fiscal year 1984 or fiscal year 1985, the Secretary shall provide under subsections (d)(2)(F) and (d)(3)(C) of this section for such equal proportional adjustment in each of the average standardized amounts otherwise computed for that fiscal year as may be necessary to assure that-

(i) the aggregate payment amounts otherwise provided under subsection (d)(1)(A)(i)(II) and (d)(5) of this section for that fiscal year for operating costs of inpatient hospital services of hospitals (excluding payments made under section 1395cc(a)(1)(F) of this title),

are not greater or less than-

(ii) the DRG percentage (as defined in subsection (d)(1)(C) of this section) of the payment amounts which would have been payable for such services for those same hospitals for that fiscal year under this section under the law as in effect before April 20, 1983 (excluding payments made under section 1395cc(a)(1)(F) of this title).

(C) For discharges occurring in fiscal year 1988, the Secretary shall provide for such equal proportional adjustment in each of the average standardized amounts otherwise computed under subsection (d)(3) of this section for that fiscal year as may be necessary to assure that-

(i) the aggregate payment amounts otherwise provided under subsections (d)(1)(A)(iii), (d)(5), and (d)(9) of this section for that fiscal year for operating costs of inpatient hospital services of subsection (d) hospitals and subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals,

are not greater or less than-

(ii) the payment amounts that would have been payable for such services for those same hospitals for that fiscal year but for the enactment of the amendments made by section 9304 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.

(2)(A) The Director of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the “Director” and the “Office”, respectively) shall provide for appointment of a Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the “Commission”), to be composed of independent experts appointed by the Director (without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service). The Commission shall review the applicable percentage increase factor described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section and make recommendations to the Secretary on the appropriate percentage change which should be effected for hospital inpatient discharges under subsections (b) and (d) of this section for fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1986. In making its recommendations, the Commission shall take into account changes in the hospital market-basket described in subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section, hospital productivity, technological and scientific advances, the quality of health care provided in hospitals (including the quality and skill level of professional nursing required to maintain quality care), and long-term cost-effectiveness in the provision of inpatient hospital services.

(B) In order to promote the efficient and effective delivery of high-quality health care services, the Commission shall, in addition to carrying out its functions under subparagraph (A), study and make recommendations for each fiscal year regarding changes in each existing reimbursement policy under this subchapter under which payments to an institution are based upon prospectively determined rates and the development of new institutional reimbursement policies under this subchapter, including recommendations relating to payments during such fiscal year under the prospective payment system established under this section for determining payments for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services, including changes in the number of diagnosis-related groups used to classify inpatient hospital discharges under subsection (d) of this section, adjustments to such groups to reflect severity of illness, and changes in the methods by which hospitals are reimbursed for capital-related costs, together with general recommendations on the effectiveness and quality of health care delivery systems in the United States and the effects on such systems of institutional reimbursements under this subchapter.

(C) By not later than June 1 of each year, the Commission shall submit a report to Congress containing an examination of issues affecting health care delivery in the United States, including issues relating to-

(i) trends in health care costs;

(ii) the financial condition of hospitals and the effect of the level of payments made to hospitals under this subchapter on such condition;

(iii) trends in the use of health care services; and

(iv) new methods used by employers, insurers, and others to constrain growth in health care costs.

(3)(A) The Commission, not later than the March 1 before the beginning of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1986), shall report its recommendations to Congress on an appropriate change factor which should be used for inpatient hospital services for discharges in that fiscal year, together with its general recommendations under paragraph (2)(B) regarding the effectiveness and quality of health care delivery systems in the United States.

(B) The Secretary, not later than April 1, 1987, for fiscal year 1988 and not later than March 1 before the beginning of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1989), shall report to the Congress the Secretary's initial estimate of the percentage change that the Secretary will recommend under paragraph (4) with respect to that fiscal year.

(4)(A) Taking into consideration the recommendations of the Commission, the Secretary shall recommend for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1988) an appropriate change factor for inpatient hospital services for discharges in that fiscal year which will take into account amounts necessary for the efficient and effective delivery of medically appropriate and necessary care of high quality. The appropriate change factor may be different for all large urban subsection (d) hospitals, other urban subsection (d) hospitals, urban subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals, rural subsection (d) hospitals, and rural subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals, and all other hospitals and units not paid under subsection (d) of this section, and may vary among such other hospitals and units.

(B) In addition to the recommendation made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall, taking into consideration the recommendations of the Commission under paragraph (2)(B), recommend for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1992) other appropriate changes in each existing reimbursement policy under this subchapter under which payments to an institution are based upon prospectively determined rates.

(5) The Secretary shall cause to have published in the Federal Register, not later than-

(A) the May 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1986), the Secretary's proposed recommendations under paragraph (4) for that fiscal year for public comment, and

(B) the September 1 before such fiscal year after such consideration of public comment on the proposal as is feasible in the time available, the Secretary's final recommendations under such paragraph for that year.

The Secretary shall include in the publication referred to in subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year the report of the Commission's recommendations submitted under paragraph (3) for that fiscal year. To the extent that the Secretary's recommendations under paragraph (4) differ from the Commission's recommendations for that fiscal year, the Secretary shall include in the publication referred to in subparagraph (A) an explanation of the Secretary's grounds for not following the Commission's recommendations.

(6)(A) The Commission shall consist of 17 individuals. Members of the Commission shall first be appointed no later than April 1, 1984, for a term of three years, except that the Director may provide initially for such shorter terms as will insure that (on a continuing basis) the terms of no more than seven members expire in any one year.

(B) The membership of the Commission shall include individuals with national recognition for their expertise in health economics, health facility management, reimbursement of health facilities or other providers of services which reflect the scope of the Commission's responsibilities, and other related fields, who provide a mix of different professionals, broad geographic representation, and a balance between urban and rural representatives, including physicians and registered professional nurses, employers, third party payors, individuals skilled in the conduct and interpretation of biomedical, health services, and health economics research, and individuals having expertise in the research and development of technological and scientific advances in health care.

(C) Subject to such review as the Office deems necessary to assure the efficient administration of the Commission, the Commission may-

(i) employ and fix the compensation of an Executive Director (subject to the approval of the Director of the Office) and such other personnel (not to exceed 25) as may be necessary to carry out its duties (without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service);

(ii) seek such assistance and support as may be required in the performance of its duties from appropriate Federal departments and agencies;

(iii) enter into contracts or make other arrangements, as may be necessary for the conduct of the work of the Commission (without regard to section 5 of title 41);

(iv) make advance, progress, and other payments which relate to the work of the Commission;

(v) provide transportation and subsistence for persons serving without compensation; and

(vi) prescribe such rules and regulations as it deems necessary with respect to the internal organization and operation of the Commission.

Section 10(a)(1) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act shall not apply to any portion of a Commission meeting if the Commission, by majority vote, determines that such portion of such meeting should be closed.

(D) While serving on the business of the Commission (including traveltime), a member of the Commission shall be entitled to compensation at the per diem equivalent of the rate provided for level IV of the Executive Schedule under section 5315 of title 5; and while so serving away from home and his regular place of business, a member may be allowed travel expenses, as authorized by the Chairman of the Commission. Physicians serving as personnel of the Commission may be provided a physician comparability allowance by the Commission in the same manner as Government physicians may be provided such an allowance by an agency under section 5948 of title 5, and for such purpose subsection (i) of such section shall apply to the Commission in the same manner as it applies to the Tennessee Valley Authority. For purposes of pay (other than pay of members of the Commission) and employment benefits, rights, and privileges, all personnel of the Commission shall be treated as if they were employees of the United States Senate.

(E) In order to identify medically appropriate patterns of health resources use in accordance with paragraph (2), the Commission shall collect and assess information on medical and surgical procedures and services, including information on regional variations of medical practice and lengths of hospitalization and on other patient-care data, giving special attention to treatment patterns for conditions which appear to involve excessively costly or inappropriate services not adding to the quality of care provided. In order to assess the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of new and existing medical and surgical procedures, the Commission shall, in coordination to the extent possible with the Secretary, collect and assess factual information, giving special attention to the needs of updating existing diagnosis-related groups, establishing new diagnosis-related groups, and making recommendations on relative weighting factors for such groups to reflect appropriate differences in resource consumption in delivering safe, efficacious, and cost-effective care. In collecting and assessing information, the Commission shall-

(i) utilize existing information, both published and unpublished, where possible, collected and assessed either by its own staff or under other arrangements made in accordance with this paragraph;

(ii) carry out, or award grants or contracts for, original research and experimentation, including clinical research, where existing information is inadequate for the development of useful and valid guidelines by the Commission; and

(iii) adopt procedures allowing any interested party to submit information with respect to medical and surgical procedures and services (including new practices, such as the use of new technologies and treatment modalities), which information the Commission shall consider in making reports and recommendations to the Secretary and Congress.

(F) The Commission shall have access to such relevant information and data as may be available from appropriate Federal agencies and shall assure that its activities, especially the conduct of original research and medical studies, are coordinated with the activities of Federal agencies.

(G)(i) The Office shall have unrestricted access to all deliberations, records, and data of the Commission, immediately upon its request.

(ii) In order to carry out its duties under this paragraph, the Office is authorized to expend reasonable and neccessary 7 funds as mutually agreed upon by the Office and the Commission. The Office shall be reimbursed for such funds by the Commission from the appropriations made with respect to the Commission.

(H) The Commission shall be subject to periodic audit by the General Accounting Office.

(I)(i) There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this paragraph.

(ii) Eighty-five percent of such appropriation shall be payable from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and 15 percent of such appropriation shall be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.

(J) The Commission shall submit requests for appropriations in the same manner as the Office submits requests for appropriations, but amounts appropriated for the Commission shall be separate from amounts appropriated for the Office.
(f) Reporting of costs of hospitals receiving payments on basis of prospective rates

(1)(A) The Secretary shall maintain a system for the reporting of costs of hospitals receiving payments computed under subsection (d) of this section.

(B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall place into effect a standardized electronic cost reporting format for hospitals under this subchapter.

(ii) The Secretary may delay or waive the implementation of such format in particular instances where such implementation would result in financial hardship (in particular with respect to hospitals with a small percentage of inpatients entitled to benefits under this subchapter).

(2) If the Secretary determines, based upon information supplied by a utilization and quality control peer review organization under part B of subchapter XI of this chapter, that a hospital, in order to circumvent the payment method established under subsection (b) or (d) of this section, has taken an action that results in the admission of individuals entitled to benefits under part A unnecessarily, unnecessary multiple admissions of the same such individuals, or other inappropriate medical or other practices with respect to such individuals, the Secretary may-

(A) deny payment (in whole or in part) under part A of this subchapter with respect to inpatient hospital services provided with respect to such an unnecessary admission (or subsequent admission of the same individual), or

(B) require the hospital to take other corrective action necessary to prevent or correct the inappropriate practice.

(3) The provisions of subsections (c) through (g) of section 1320a–7 of this title shall apply to determinations made under paragraph (2) in the same manner as they apply to exclusions effected under section 1320a–7(b)(13) of this title.
(g) Prospective payment for capital-related costs; return on equity capital for hospitals

(1)(A) Notwithstanding section 1395x(v) of this title, instead of any amounts that are otherwise payable under this subchapter with respect to the reasonable costs of subsection (d) hospitals and subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals for capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services, the Secretary shall, for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, provide for payments for such costs in accordance with a prospective payment system established by the Secretary. Aggregate payments made under subsection (d) of this section and this subsection during fiscal years 1992 through 1995 shall be reduced in a manner that results in a reduction (as estimated by the Secretary) in the amount of such payments equal to a 10 percent reduction in the amount of payments attributable to capital-related costs that would otherwise have been made during such fiscal year had the amount of such payments been based on reasonable costs (as defined in section 1395x(v) of this title). For discharges occurring after September 30, 1993, the Secretary shall reduce by 7.4 percent the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate (as described in 42 CFR 412.308(c), as in effect on August 10, 1993) and shall (for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993) redetermine which payment methodology is applied to the hospital under such system to take into account such reduction.

(B) Such system-

(i) shall provide for (I) a payment on a per discharge basis, and (II) an appropriate weighting of such payment amount as relates to the classification of the discharge;

(ii) may provide for an adjustment to take into account variations in the relative costs of capital and construction for the different types of facilities or areas in which they are located;

(iii) may provide for such exceptions (including appropriate exceptions to reflect capital obligations) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, and

(iv) may provide for suitable adjustment to reflect hospital occupancy rate.

(C) Medicare patient load

As used in subparagraph (A), the term “medicare patient load” means, with respect to a hospital's cost reporting period, the fraction of the total number of inpatient-bed-days (as established by the Secretary) during the period which are attributable to patients with respect to whom payment may be made under part A of this subchapter.
(4) Determination of full-time-equivalent residents
(A) Rules

The Secretary shall establish rules consistent with this paragraph for the computation of the number of full-time-equivalent residents in an approved medical residency training program.
(B) Adjustment for part-year or part-time residents

Such rules shall take into account individuals who serve as residents for only a portion of a period with a hospital or simultaneously with more than one hospital.
(C) Weighting factors for certain residents

(iii) on or after July 1, 1986, and before July 1, 1987, for a resident who is not in the resident's initial residency period (as defined in paragraph (5)(F)), the weighting factor is .75, and

(iv) on or after July 1, 1987, for a resident who is not in the resident's initial residency period (as defined in paragraph (5)(F)), the weighting factor is .50.
(D) Foreign medical graduates required to pass FMGEMS examination
(i) In general

Except as provided in clause (ii), such rules shall provide that, in the case of an individual who is a foreign medical graduate (as defined in paragraph (5)(D)), the individual shall not be counted as a resident on or after July 1, 1986, unless-

(I) the individual has passed the FMGEMS examination (as defined in paragraph (5)(E)), or

(II) the individual has previously received certification from, or has previously passed the examination of, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates.
(ii) Transition for current FMGS

(II) has not passed the FMGEMS examination or a previous examination of the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates before July 1, 1986,

 the individual shall be counted as a resident at a rate equal to one-half of the rate at which the individual would otherwise be counted.
(E) Counting time spent in outpatient settings

Such rules shall provide that only time spent in activities relating to patient care shall be counted and that all the time so spent by a resident under an approved medical residency training program shall be counted towards the determination of full-time equivalency, without regard to the setting in which the activities are performed, if the hospital incurs all, or substantially all, of the costs for the training program in that setting.

(d) of this section].

“(2)(A) The Secretary shall study and report annually to the Congress at the end of each year (beginning with 1984 and ending with 1989) on the impact, of the payment methodology under section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act [subsec.

The Secretary shall submit to Congress, not later than July 1, 1985, a report to Congress which includes recommendations on the advisability and feasibility of providing for determining the amount of the payments for physicians’ services furnished to hospital inpatients based on the DRG type classification of the discharges of those inpatients, and legislative recommendations thereon.

“(C) In the annual report to Congress under subparagraph (A) for 1985, the Secretary shall include the results of studies on-

“(i) the feasibility and impact of eliminating or phasing out separate urban and rural DRG prospective payment rates under paragraph (3) of section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act [subsec. (d)(3) of this section];

“(ii) whether and the method under which hospitals, not paid based on amounts determined under such section, can be paid for inpatient hospital services on a prospective basis as under such section;

“(iii) the appropriateness of the factors used under paragraph (5)(A) of such section to compensate hospitals for the additional expenses of outlier cases, and the application of severity of illness, intensity of care, or other modifications to the diagnosis-related groups, and the advisability and feasibility of providing for such modifications;

“(iv) the feasibility and desirability of applying the payment methodology under such section to payment by all payors for inpatient hospital services; and

“(v) the impact of such section on hospital admissions and the feasibility of making a volume adjustment in the DRG prospective payment rates or requiring preadmission certification in order to minimize the incentive to increase admissions.

Such report shall specifically include, with respect to the item described in clause (iv), consideration of the extent of cost-shifting to non-Federal payors and the impact of such cost-shifting on health insurance costs and premiums borne by employers and employees.

“(D) In the annual report to Congress under subparagraph (A) for 1986, the Secretary shall include the results of a study examining the overall impact of State systems of hospital payment (either approved under section 1886(c) of the Social Security Act [subsec. (c) of this section] or under a waiver approved under section 402(a) of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 [section 1395b–1(a) of this title] or section 222(a) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972) [Pub. L. 92–603, set out as a note under 1395b–1 of this title], particularly assessing such systems’ impact not only on the medicare program but also on the medicaid program, on payments and premiums under private health insurance plans, and on tax expenditures.

“(i) an evaluation of the adequacy of the procedures for assuring quality of post-hospital services furnished under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [this subchapter],

“(ii) an assessment of problems that have prevented groups of medicare beneficiaries (including those eligible for medical assistance under title XIX of such Act [subchapter XIX of this chapter]) from receiving appropriate post-hospital services covered under such title, and

“(iii) information on reconsiderations and appeals taken under title XVIII of such Act [this subchapter] with respect to payment for post-hospital services.

“(3)(A) The Secretary shall complete a study and make legislative recommendations to the Congress with respect to an equitable method of reimbursing sole community hospitals which takes into account their unique vulnerability to substantial variations in occupancy.

“(B) In addition, the Secretary shall examine ways to coordinate an information transfer between parts A and B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act [parts A and B of this subchapter], particularly with respect to those cases where a denial of coverage is made under part A of such title and no adjustment is made in the reimbursement to the admitting physician or physicians.

“(C) The Secretary shall also report on the appropriate treatment of uncompensated care costs, and adjustments that might be appropriate for large teaching hospitals located in rural areas.

“(D) The Secretary shall also report on the advisability of having hospitals make available information on the cost of care to patients financed by both public programs and private payors.

“(E) The studies and reports described in this paragraph shall be completed and submitted not later than April 1, 1985.

“(4) The Secretary shall complete a study and make recommendations to the Congress, before April 1, 1984, with respect to a method for including hospitals located outside of the fifty States and the District of Columbia under a prospective payment system.”
